# BloodGlucoseAutomation
Med-Sync is inspired by patients who don't let their chronic conditions prevent them from living out their lives. Seeing these men and women's bravery has inspired us to create a hack that can make their lives that much better. Med-Sync allows diabetes patients to sync their blood glucose data to the cloud using a variety of IoT devices. In addition, these data backups are instantly provided to each patient's physician so they can react to their patient's status in real-time. The project also uses machine learning project blood glucose levels over time to offer more analytics so physicians and patients can make more informed medical decisions. Med-Sync will make an impact on the many men and women across the world who suffer from high blood sugar and diabetes-like conditions. With chronic medical conditions on the rise, we are devoted to sustaining the human condition through health and safety. Med-Sync has the power to allow these patients to live their life freely.
